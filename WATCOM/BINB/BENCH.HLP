::::BROWSE_WINDOW
			   Browsing Window
			   ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
A browsing window is used to select or view items. The general format
of the window is as follows:
   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄtitleÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
   ³					   ³
   ³   list of scrolling items		   ³
   ³					   ³
   ³Escape=Cancel	       Enter=Select³
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
There will be a scroll bar (see <SCROLL_BAR>) on the right of the
window if the number of items is greater than the capacity of the
window.
 
You can cancel the window by pressing the Escape (Esc) key.
 
When the "Enter=Select" hotspot is present, you can select an item in
the scrolling area by making that item the current item and then
pressing the Enter key (the Enter key is ignored when the window is to
be used for viewing only). You can change the current item by pressing
the CURSOR-UP or the CURSOR-DOWN keys.
 
When the scroll bar is present, the list of items will scroll in the
window when you press the CURSOR-UP (CURSOR-DOWN) key when the current
item is at the top (bottom) of the window. You can also display the
next (last) window of items by pressing the PgDn (PgUp) keys. You can
position to the start (end) of the list of items by pressing the Ctrl
and PgUp (Ctrl and PgDn) keys simultaneously.
 
If your computer has a mouse attached to it, you can use the scroll
bar (see <SCROLL_BAR>) to reposition what is being displayed. You can
select an item by pressing and releasing the leftmost button of the
mouse while the mouse cursor is positioned within that item.
::::CHECK_FIELD

is within that field. The check field becomes the current field.
::::DIRECTORY_BROWSE
			  Directory Browser
			  ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
A directory can be selected using a Directory Browsing window which
appears as follows:
   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
   ³   Directory Field			   ³
   ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ´

   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
Initially, the cursor is positioned at the start of the scrolling
directory field at the top of the form. This field contains the
current directory to be selected. You can switch between the directory
field and the scrolling area by using the TAB key.
 
You can press the Escape (Esc) key to cancel the directory browser.
 
You can press the F2 function key to receive a list of the drives on
your computer (see <DRIVE_BROWSE>). You can select one of these drives
to become the drive from which directories are displayed by the
directory browser.
 
Directory Field
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The directory name that is displayed in the directory field determines
the directory to be selected. When the directory browser was initiated
from the file browser, the directory field will contain the name of
the directory from which files were being displayed by the file
browser.
 
You select this directory by pressing the Enter key when the current
field is the directory field.
 
You can type a DOS directory name (see <DIRECTORY_NAME>) in this field
or you can select one of the directories in the scrolling area to be
placed in this area.
 
Scrolling Area
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The scrolling area shows the directories on the current drive. The
scrolling area scrolls in the usual way using the cursor keys, PgUp
(display previous page), PgDn (display next page), Ctrl/PgUp (display,
starting at beginning), and Ctrl/PgDn (display, last portion).
 
The directories are shown with lines preceding them to denote the
hierarchical structure of the sub-directories. Each line corresponds
to one sub-directory.
 
You can select a directory in the scrolling area by pressing the Enter
key when that directory name is the current field. The full directory
name will be copied to the directory field which will become the
current field.
 
Mouse
ÍÍÍÍÍ
 
If there is a mouse attached to your computer (see <MOUSE>), then you
can position to the directory field by pressing and releasing the
leftmost mouse button while the mouse cursor is positioned on that
field.
 
If you press and release the mouse while the mouse cursor is
positioned on a directory in the scrolling area, then that directory
will be selected into the directory field. You can also use the mouse
in conjunction with the scroll bar (see <SCROLL_BAR>) to change the
directory names displayed in the scrolling area.
 
If you "double-click" on a directory field, then that directory will
be the one selected. You "double-click" the mouse by pressing and
releasing the leftmost mouse button two times, within a short time
interval.
::::DIRECTORY_DIALOGUE
			  Directory Dialogue
			  ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The directory window contains fields for the device and directory for
which files are to be displayed in the file browsing window. You can
change these fields. When you press Enter, the window will disappear
and file names from the new directory will appear. If you press the
Esc (escape) key, the window is cancelled and the directory from which
files are displayed is unchanged.
 
Directory browsing
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
Alternately, you can reset the device and directory fields by using
the path browser (press F2) or the directory browser (press F3). The
directory browser shows a full tree representation of the directories
on the current disk drive (see <DIRECTORY_BROWSE>). The path browser
shows only the path to the current directory and the sub-directories
found within the current directory (see <PATH_BROWSE>). If you have
many directories on your disk drive, you may find excessive the time
that is required to build the full display shown by the directory
browser (all directories on the drive need to be read).
::::DIRECTORY_NAME
			   Directory names
			   ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
Valid directory names have the following format:
   [ drive: ] [\] [ name ] [ \name ] ... [ \name ]
where "name" is an existing sub-directory name. Some examples are:
   C:\PROJECT1
   C:\PROJECT1\DATA
   C:\PROJECT1\DATA\BUDGET
When the drive is omitted, the current drive is used. The following
names are equivalent to the preceding names when the current drive is
"C":
   \PROJECT1
   \PROJECT1\DATA
   \PROJECT1\DATA\BUDGET
When there is no "\" preceding the first sub-directory name, the
entered sub-directories are assumed to be sub-directories of the
current working directory on the indicated drive. Thus, if the current
working directory on drive "C" is "PROJECT", then the three
directories could have been given as:
   C:
   C:DATA
   C:DATA\BUDGET
The special directory named "."
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
 
With DOS, each drive has a special directory termed the "current
working directory" to which file names apply when there is no path
specification preceding the file name. This directory can be
referenced by ".". Thus, if your current working directory is
C:\PROJECT1\DATA, then, the following are equivalent:
   .	       C:\PROJECT1\DATA
   .\JUNE      C:\PROJECT1\DATA\JUNE
The special directory name ".."
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
When ".." is used as a directory name, then, it refers to the parent
directory of in the directory path to that point (or the parent
directory of the current directory at the start). Thus, the following
are equivalent when the current directory is C:\PROJECT1\DATA
   ..		       C:\PROJECT1
   ..\REPORT	       C:\PROJECT1\REPORT
   ..\..\PROJECT2\DATA c:\PROJECT2\DATA
::::DOS_SERVICES
			     DOS Services
			     ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The Control menus all contain an item "DOS Services" which, when
chosen, causes the following actions to occur:
   * the current application is suspended
   * the DOS command interpreter is activated
   * DOS commands can now be entered
The current application resumes when the DOS "EXIT" command is
entered.
::::DRIVE_BROWSE
			     DRIVE_BROWSE
			     ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
A drive is selected using a Drive Browsing window which appears as
follows:
   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
   ³   current drive			   ³

   ³Escape=Cancel	       Enter=Select³
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
Initially, the cursor is positioned at the drive field at the top of
the form. This field contains the current drive to be selected. You
can switch between the drive field and the scrolling area by using the
TAB key.
 
You can press the Escape (Esc) key to cancel the drive browser.
 
When the drive is for removable media (such as a diskette drive), the
text "-removable" is shown following the drive letter. Otherwise, the
volume identification for that drive is displayed.
 
Drive Field
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The drive name that is displayed in the drive field determines the
drive to be selected. When the drive browser is initiated from the
directory browser, the drive field will contain the drive for which
directories were being displayed.
 
You select this drive by pressing the Enter key when the current field
is the drive field.
 
You can type a valid DOS drive letter in this field or you can select
one of the drives in the scrolling area to be placed in this field.
 
Scrolling Area
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The scrolling area shows the drives on your computer. The scrolling
area scrolls in the usual way using the cursor keys, PgUp (display
previous page), PgDn (display next page), Ctrl/PgUp (display, starting
at beginning), and Ctrl/PgDn (display, last portion).
 
You can select a drive in the scrolling area by pressing the Enter key
when that drive is the current field.
 
Drive names are followed by:
   - removable	   (for diskette drives)
   volume label    (for hard disk drives)
Mouse
ÍÍÍÍÍ
 
If there is a mouse attached to your computer (see <MOUSE>), then you
can position to the drive field by pressing and releasing the leftmost
mouse button while the mouse cursor is positioned on that field.
 
If you press and release the mouse while the mouse cursor is
positioned on a drive in the scrolling area, then that drive will be
selected into the drive field. You can also use the mouse in
conjunction with the scroll bar (see <SCROLL_BAR>) to change the drive
names displayed in the scrolling area.
 
If you "double-click" on a drive field, then that drive will be the
one selected. You "double-click" the mouse by pressing and releasing
the leftmost mouse button two times, within a short time interval.

	   ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
Display options
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
Display options are check fields (see <CHECK_FIELD>) which determine
what can be displayed about a file name. When the option is true (an
"X" is shown), the file browser will display the corresponding
information for each file. The options are:
   Time:	the time that the file was last updated
   Date:	the date that the file was last updated
   File Size:	the size of the file
   Attribute:	the file attributes
   Description: a file description for the extension
Attributes are shown as letters where
   A: file has not been archived
   R: file is read/only
Descriptions are based upon the file extension and indicate the
probable use of that file. For example, the WP word processor uses
files with an extension of "DOC" and the WATCOM Spreadsheet uses an
extension of "WSS".
 
Directory Browsing
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
There are three radio buttons (see <RADIO_BUTTON>) to determine what
type of directory browsing should be obtained from the file browsing
window:
   Path Browsing       (see <PATH_BROWSE>)
   Directory Browsing  (see <DIRECTORY_BROWSE>)
   Directory Dialogue  (see <DIRECTORY_DIALOGUE>)
File Pattern
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The window also contains a field for the file pattern used to select
file names to be displayed. This field shows the pattern used to
restrict the files to be displayed. An application may set a pattern
to restrict the display to only files with a particular file
extension. You can change this pattern if you wish only certain files
to be displayed.
 
A pattern "*.*" will cause all files to be displayed.
 
A file name consists of up to eight characters followed by an optional
period and an optional file extension of up to three characters. Some
valid file names are:
   MYDATA
   MYDATA.DAT
   BUDGET.DAT
   MORE.DAT
A file name which matches the pattern will be displayed.
 
The pattern can contain special characters "?" and "*". Characters in
the pattern and the file name are compared one at a time according to
the following rules:
  (1) A "?" matches any character in a file name.
  (2) A "*" causes the remaining characters in a file name or
      extension to match.
  (3) Any other character must match the corresponding character in
      the file name.
Some examples are:
	       *.*     *.dat   mydata.*    m*.dat  m?data.*
   MYDATA      match	       match		   match
   MYDATA.DAT  match   match   match	   match   match
   MODATA.DAT  match   match		   match   match
   BUDGET.DAT  match   match
   MONDAY.DAT  match   match		   match
Include sub-directories in Browse window
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
When this check field (see <CHECK_FIELD>) is set (an asterisk (*)
appears), the parent directory (unless you are at the root of the
device) and any sub-directories will be displayed in the scrolling
area of the file browser. The parent directory is shown as:
   * parent directory
and a sub-directory "XXXX" is shown as
   * sub-directory: XXXX
Remember last directory browsed.
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
When this check field (see <CHECK_FIELD>) is set (an asterisk (*)
appears), the system will remember the directory in which you were
browsing. This directory will be used as the starting directory the
next time that the file browser is activated during your current
session.
 
When the field is not set, the initial directory is your current
working directory.

::::MENUS
			   How to use Menus
			   ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
When you start an application, you are presented with a "menu bar" on
the first line of the screen. Each of the names on that line
represents a menu of actions that you can request.
 
Using the keyboard
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
You can activate the menu bar by pressing and releasing the Alt key.
You can then cycle through the menu names on the menu bar by pressing
the cursor-right or cursor-left keys. You can deactivate the menu bar
by pressing the Escape key.
 
When the menu bar is active, each name has a unique "hot letter" which
is high-lighted within the menu-bar name. If you press the key for one
of those letters, the associated menu will be pulled down. When the
menu bar is active, you can also pull down a menu by pressing any of
the cursor-down, cursor-up, or Enter keys.
 
When a menu is pulled down, you can then cycle through the menus by
pressing the cursor-right or cursor-left keys.
 
When a menu is first pulled down, the first item in the menu is
highlighted to indicate that it is the current item. You can press the
cursor-down or the cursor-up keys to change the current item.
 
If you wish to cancel the menu-selection process, press the Escape key
(Esc) and the current menu will disappear.
 
If you wish to select one of the actions, use the cursor-up and/or
cursor-down keys to make that action the current item (the
high-lighted one) and then press the Enter key. Alternatively, you can
type the "hot letter" which is high-lighted within the menu item.
 
Using the mouse (see also <MOUSE>)
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The menu for an item on the menu bar will be pulled down when you
press the leftmost mouse button while the mouse cursor is within that
item, and then drag downwards (without releasing the mouse button ).
To select an item from the menu, drag the mouse (move the mouse
without releasing the mouse button) so that the mouse cursor is within
the item to be selected and then release the mouse button.
 
If you drag the mouse to another menu name on the menu bar, then the
menu for the new name is pulled down. The menu for the old name will
disappear.
 
If you decide that you wish to cancel the menu-selection process, be
careful to release the mouse button while the mouse cursor is not
positioned within either the menu bar or within a menu.
 
If you wish to pull down a menu, press and release the leftmost mouse
button, while the mouse cursor is within that menu name on the menu
bar.
 
If you wish to cancel a pulled-down menu, press and release the
leftmost mouse button, while the mouse cursor is within the name of
the menu on the menu bar.
 
::::MOUSE
			   Using the Mouse
			   ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
General Information
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The mouse is a pointing device. As you move the mouse, the mouse
cursor (a rectangular box) will move correspondingly about the screen.
Moving the mouse, without pressing any of the button(s) on it has no
effect except to move the mouse cursor.
 
The first mouse button (the leftmost one) or the only one, depending
upon the particular mouse that you have, is used to signal the
pointing interaction. When you press the button, you are starting a
mouse interaction that is completed when you release that button. The
particular interaction depends on the location of the mouse cursor
when you press the mouse.
 
The term "click the mouse" means to press and then to immediately
release the leftmost button on the mouse without moving it. Typically,
you click the mouse to select an item, to invert the value of a check
field (see <CHECK_FIELD>), or to set a radio button (see
<RADIO_BUTTON>).
 
The term "drag the mouse" means to move the mouse while the mouse
button is depressed. Typically, you drag the mouse while a mouse

Using the mouse with menus (see also <MENUS>)
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The menu for an item on the menu bar will be pulled down when you
press the leftmost mouse button while the mouse cursor is within that
item, and then drag downwards (without releasing the mouse button ).
To select an item from the menu, drag the mouse (move the mouse
without releasing the mouse button) so that the mouse cursor is within
the item to be selected and then release the mouse button.
 
If you drag the mouse to another menu name on the menu bar, then the
menu for the new name is pulled down. The menu for the old name will
disappear.
 
If you decide that you wish to cancel the menu-selection process, be
careful to release the mouse button while the mouse cursor is not
positioned within either the menu bar or within a menu.
 
If you wish to pull down a menu, press and release the leftmost mouse
button, while the mouse cursor is within that menu name on the menu
bar.
 
If you wish to cancel a pulled-down menu, press and release the
leftmost mouse button, while the mouse cursor is within the name of
the menu on the menu bar.
 
Using the mouse with Hot Spots
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
Hot spots are areas on the screen which contain text indicating
function keys or special keys such as Escape or Enter. You can see a
number areas at the bottom of the area for this help text.
 
If you have a mouse, clicking the mouse on a hot spot is equivalent to
pressing the indicated key. If you don't have a mouse, then these
areas cannot be used (instead, use the indicated keys from the
keyboard to activate the function).
 
Using the mouse while editing
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
If you click the mouse on an editable field into which data can be
typed, the keyboard cursor is positioned to the field. The keyboard
position is identical to the position of the mouse cursor if there is
a non-blank character at that position or to the right of that
position; otherwise, the keyboard cursor is positioned immediately
following the right-most non-blank character.
 
If you click the mouse on a check field, the value of the field is
changed. A check field is preceded by "[X]" to indicate that the value
is true and by "[ ]" to indicate a false value. See <CHECK_FIELD> for
more details.
 
If you click the mouse on a radio button, that button becomes the
active button (and the previous active button becomes inactive). The
active radio button is indicated by "(*)" at the start of the field;
other buttons in that set of radio buttons will start with "( )". See
<RADIO_BUTTON> for more details.
 
In these cases, you don't actually have to click the mouse, although
this is what you would normally do. To be more precise, you must press
the mouse button while the mouse cursor is within the framed window
containing the field in question. The button is released while the
mouse cursor is within the field in question (the mouse could have
been dragged to that field).
::::PATH_BROWSE
			     Path Browser
			     ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
A directory can be selected using the Path Browsing window which
appears as follows:
   ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
   ³   current directory		   ³
   ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ´
   ³					   ³
   ³					   ³
   ³   scrolling list of directories	   ³
   ³   in path				   ³
   ³					   ³
   ³Escape=Cancel   ....       Enter=Select³
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
Initially, the cursor is positioned at the start of the scrolling
directory field at the top of the form. This field contains the
current directory to be selected. You can switch between the directory
field and the scrolling area by using the TAB key.
 
You can press the Escape (Esc) key to cancel the path browser.
 
You can press the F2 function key to receive a list of the drives on
your computer (see <DRIVE_BROWSE>). You can select one of these drives
to become the drive from which directories are displayed by the
directory browser.
 
Directory Field
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The directory name that is displayed in the directory field determines
the directory to be selected. When the path browser was initiated from
the directory window, the directory field will contain the name of the
directory on the drive displayed on that window.
 
You select this directory by pressing the Enter key when the current
field is the directory field.
 
You can type a DOS directory name (see <DIRECTORY_NAME>) in this field
or you can select one of the directories in the scrolling area to be
placed in this area. In either case, the display will change to
reflect the path selected.
 
Scrolling Area
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The scrolling area shows the path to the directory in the directory
field and the sub-directories of that directory. If you select any of
the directories that are displayed, that directory replaces the
directory in the directory field and the scrolling area is re-drawn
for the selected directory. Thus, with successive selections, you can
quickly change the displayed path and locate the directory for which
you are searching.
 
The scrolling area scrolls in the usual way using the cursor keys,
PgUp (display previous page), PgDn (display next page), Ctrl/PgUp
(display, starting at beginning), and Ctrl/PgDn (display, last
portion).
 
Mouse
ÍÍÍÍÍ
 
If there is a mouse attached to your computer (see <MOUSE>), then you
can position to the directory field by pressing and releasing the
leftmost mouse button while the mouse cursor is positioned on that
field.
 
If you press and release the mouse while the mouse cursor is
positioned on a directory in the scrolling area, then that directory
will be selected into the directory field and the scrolling area will
be re-drawn. You can also use the mouse in conjunction with the scroll
bar (see <SCROLL_BAR>) to change the directory names displayed in the
scrolling area.
 
If you "double-click" on a directory field, then that directory will
be the one selected. You "double-click" the mouse by pressing and
releasing the leftmost mouse button two times, within a short time
interval.
::::RADIO_BUTTON
			    Radio Buttons
			    ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
A set of radio buttons appears as follows:
       ( ) button-1
       ( ) button-2
       . . .
       ( ) button-N
The fields may be arranged horizontally, vertically, or in a
rectangle, depending upon their usage in a particular window. At most
one of the fields is true and is preceded by (*). When you set a radio
button to be true, the button that was previously true is set to be
false.
 
When you cycle through the fields on a form using the TAB keys, only
the current radio button (the one which is true) is visited.
 
When the current field is a radio button and the buttons occur on more
than one line, then the CURSOR-UP and the CURSOR-DOWN keys will cycle
around the set of radio buttons in a vertical manner. When the current
button is on a line containing more than one button from the current
set, then the CURSOR-RIGHT and CURSOR-LEFT keys will cycle around the
buttons in the current set on that line. The current radio button is
always set to be true.
 
Setting a radio button with the keyboard
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
You can set a radio button by positioning to that field.
 
Setting a radio button with the mouse
ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
You can set a radio button by clicking the mouse while the mouse
cursor is within that radio button. The radio button becomes the
current field.
::::SCROLL_BAR
			     Scroll Bars
			     ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
A scroll bar is used when the information to be displayed is too large
to fit in a display area. A scroll bar can be vertical (displayed up
and down) when the information is too long and can be horizontal
(displayed left and right) when the information is too wide.
 
The bar contains two symbols (called icons) at each end plus an area
in the middle which contains a slider that is used to indicate the
relative position of the information being displayed to the total
information. When the display area is too small, the middle area and
the page-up and page-down icons may be eliminated from the scroll bar.
 
If your computer does not have a mouse attached to it, the scroll bar
is for display purposes only: it will indicate the relative position
of the text being displayed. You can reposition the display text by
pressing the PgUp, PgDn (TAB-FORWARD, TAB-BACKWARD) and the
cursor-positioning keys (denoted with arrows on the keyboard).
 
When you can use a mouse, the scroll bar can be used to reposition the
information being displayed. First, you must press the leftmost button
of the mouse while the mouse cursor is located on the scroll bar. The
position of the mouse cursor when you release the mouse, determines
the repositioning. If the mouse cursor is not on the scroll bar at
this point, no repositioning will take place. If the cursor is on the
first icon at the top (left) of the scroll bar, the information will
scroll down (right) one line (column). If the cursor is on the first
icon at the bottom (right) of the scroll bar, the information will
scroll up (left) one line (column). If the cursor is on the second
icon at the top (left) of the scroll bar, the information will scroll
down (right) by the size of the display area. If the cursor is on the
second icon at the bottom (right) of the scroll bar, the information
will scroll up (left) by the size of the display area. If the cursor
is in the middle area of the scroll bar, the slider is positioned to
indicate the position of the information to be displayed when the
mouse button is released.
::::SELECT_PRINTER
			Select current printer
			ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ
 
The current printer is the device to which printed output is directed.
The InfoBench system can be configured to have more than one such
printer if there is more than one printer attached to your computer. A
physical printer can also be configured in a number of different ways.
 
The printer selection window shows the names of printers that have
been configured as a list of radio buttons (see <RADIO_BUTTON>). The
current printer is the one with "(*)" at the start of the name.
 
You can change the radio button to another printer by making that
field the current field and then pressing the space bar. If there is a
mouse attached to your computer, you can accomplish the same by
positioning the mouse cursor within the field and then pressing and
releasing the leftmost mouse button.
 
The current printer is changed (and the selection window is removed)
when you press the Enter key. If you press the Esc (escape) key, the
selection window is cancelled and the current printer will be
unchanged.
